Build a new mobile app inspired by the iOS app “Mesba7a / mesba7a” (digital tasbeeh counter). Do NOT copy any proprietary code or exact artwork; create an original design and implementation with similar functionality.

Tech:
- Use Flutter (preferred) and target iOS + Android.
- Use Material 3, modern clean UI, smooth animations.
- Use local persistence (SharedPreferences) so counters and settings survive app restart.
- Support Arabic + English (RTL/LTR), with a language toggle in Settings.

Core screens:
1) Home (Counter)
   - Big central counter number
   - Main “Tap” area (full screen tap) to increment
   - Haptic feedback toggle
   - Undo last increment
   - Reset with confirmation
   - Goal/target setting (e.g., 33, 99, 100, custom) with progress ring
   - Session stats: today count, total count
   - Optional sound toggle

2) Dhikr Presets
   - Built-in presets (e.g., SubhanAllah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illa Allah, Astaghfirullah)
   - Each preset has its own saved count and target
   - Ability to add/edit/delete custom presets (name, target, color)

3) History / Analytics
   - Daily totals chart (last 7/30 days)
   - Streak tracking (optional)
   - Export/backup to JSON file (optional)

4) Settings
   - Theme: Light/Dark/System + accent color picker
   - Haptics on/off
   - Sound on/off
   - Auto-lock prevention toggle (keep screen on while counting)
   - Language: Arabic/English
   - About page

UI/UX requirements (make it “better looking”):
- Elegant minimal design, rounded cards, subtle gradients, modern typography
- Smooth micro-interactions: tap ripple, counter bounce animation, progress ring animation
- Accessibility: large tap area, dynamic text sizes, high contrast option
- Use icons that match platform style
- Keep the app fast and offline-only

Implementation details:
- App architecture: simple clean structure (lib/screens, lib/widgets, lib/models, lib/services)
- State management: Riverpod (or Provider) with clear separation
- Data model: Preset(id, name, target, color, count, createdAt), DailyLog(date, total)
- Persist: presets list + counts + daily logs
- Include unit tests for increment/reset/undo and persistence
- Provide clear README with run/build steps and screenshots.

Deliverables:
- Working app in Replit
- Clean code, comments where needed
- Polished UI that feels premium
