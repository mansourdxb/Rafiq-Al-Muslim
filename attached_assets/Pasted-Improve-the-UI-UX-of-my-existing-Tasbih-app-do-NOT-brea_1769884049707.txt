Improve the UI/UX of my existing “Tasbih” app (do NOT break functionality). Goal: premium, modern, minimal design with better typography, spacing, and micro-interactions. Keep current features (counter, presets dropdown, today/all-time stats, tabs).

UI redesign requirements:
1) Global Theme
- Use a consistent design system: 8px spacing grid, rounded corners (16–22), soft shadows, subtle borders.
- Adopt a calm palette: near-white background with a slight tint, primary accent purple/indigo, neutral text.
- Improve typography: larger bold number, clearer labels, better hierarchy.
- Add dark mode support (system + manual toggle if profile/settings exists).
- Ensure RTL-ready layout if Arabic is enabled.

2) Counter Showing Area
- Replace plain background with a soft gradient (very subtle).
- Make the ring progress smoother and thicker, with rounded line caps and a light grey track.
- Add a gentle “bounce” animation on increment (number + ring).
- Add haptic feedback on tap (if supported).
- Make the whole ring tappable to increment (big touch target). Also provide a small + button for accessibility.

3) Preset Selector
- Convert preset selector into a nicer pill/dropdown: icon + label, centered, with subtle border.
- Add a “Target” chip (33/99/custom) next to it.
- Add quick target change UI (bottom sheet modal) with common targets + custom input.

4) Stats Cards (Today / All Time)
- Redesign into two elevated cards with:
  - icon in a soft colored container
  - label + value with better alignment
  - subtle divider or secondary text (e.g., “taps”)
- Add a third optional card “Streak” if tracking exists; otherwise keep two.

5) Bottom Navigation
- Make it cleaner: icons + labels, active tab uses accent color and a small indicator.
- Ensure safe area padding and consistent height.

6) Polishing
- Improve empty states on Presets/Profile screens.
- Use smooth transitions between tabs.
- Ensure everything is responsive for small screens.

Implementation instructions:
- Identify the UI framework used (React Native Expo or Flutter). Use best practices for that framework.
- Create a theme file (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows).
- Refactor existing screens to use shared components:
  - <StatCard />
  - <PresetPill />
  - <ProgressRing />
  - <ScreenContainer />
- Do NOT change data model or business logic; only presentation + interaction improvements.
- Run the app and fix any layout glitches.

Deliverables:
- Commit changes with clear message “UI polish: premium redesign”
- Provide a short summary of what changed and where (files touched).
